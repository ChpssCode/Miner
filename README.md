# Miner
Miner is a 2D Idle-inspired clicker game we’re you’re goal is to conquer, upgrade, and farm planets resources in exchange for a virtual in game currency. With this currency, you can conquer, upgrade, and farm new planets until you eventually conquer every planet in the game and become the richest player in the galaxy!

## Why is this a public repository?
I made this a public repository because I wanted others to critique and maybe even learn from my progress with my game. This project was also made for a school project.

## What inspired Miner?
Truly, Miner was inspired by my love for science fiction and the imaginary worlds I makeup in my head(probably when I am not supposed to lol). I also took a lot of inspiration from shows/movies like Star Wars, Another Life, and one of the best books I have personally ever read in my opinion, the Ocean between the Stars
